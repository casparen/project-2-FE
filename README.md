# project-2-FE

##Synopsis
For the second project I decided to build a web application that finds the best coffee/smoothies shops around the user. Which then can be personally rated and saved in their favorites so they always can view their best experiences. In addition to the shops the user can view all the free wifi spots in New York.

## How it works
The user selects either coffee or smoothie from the dropdown window, a few seconds later little dots show up on the map and the user is able to click on them to either view more information or add them to their favorites.


## Motivation

My motivation was my passion for coffee shops. When I travel to a new city, the first thing I liked to know is where to find the best coffee shop near me.

## API Reference

Google maps API: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/

NYC open data API:

## Process
As for my last project I started off with sketching and researching API's. It was a lot of back and forth while deciding which idea and which API to pursue. Eventually I decided on an idea, and I started white boarding everything out and then started to write the code. I hit many obstacles, however with each wall I hit I learned something new and I was able to build around it.
